# See your direct data rate

> Get started with Iroh Services in minutes

### What is direct data rate?

When two iroh endpoints connect, traffic either flows **directly** between them
(peer-to-peer) or gets routed through a relay server. Direct connections are
faster and cheaper. Relayed traffic adds latency and burns relay bandwidth.

**Direct data rate** is the percentage of your network's traffic flowing
directly. A **high rate** means NAT traversal is working and your users are getting
the best possible connection. A **low rate** means too much traffic is falling back
to relays, which is worth investigating.

This guide walks you through hooking up your first endpoint to Iroh Services so
you can see direct data rate and other connectivity metrics for your own
network. You'll need an [Iroh Services
account](https://services.iroh.computer?utm_source=docs\&utm_content=quickstart)
with an [API key](https://docs.iroh.computer/iroh-services/access.md).

### Add the Iroh Services Client

In Rust, add the `iroh-services` crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
cargo add iroh-services
```

The Python, Swift, and Kotlin bindings ship the services client as part of
`iroh-ffi`, with no extra dependency needed.

### Connect Your Endpoint

Then, in your code, create a client and connect your endpoint to Iroh Services. Giving the endpoint a name makes it easy to identify on the dashboard; unnamed endpoints are harder to distinguish from each other.

```rust Rust theme={null}
use iroh::Endpoint;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Build a preset from your API key. In production, load the key from a
    // config file or environment variable instead of hardcoding it.
    let preset = iroh_services::preset()
        .api_secret_from_str("YOUR_API_KEY")?
        .build()?;

    // Create an iroh endpoint with the preset
    let endpoint = Endpoint::bind(preset.clone()).await?;

    // Wait for the endpoint to be online
    endpoint.online().await;

    // Create the Iroh Services client. `client_builder` reuses the preset's
    // API key, which also carries the address of the service to dial.
    let client = preset
        .client_builder(&endpoint)
        .name("my-endpoint")?
        .build()
        .await?;

    // Your endpoint is now reporting metrics to Iroh Services!

    Ok(())
}
```

```python Python theme={null}
import asyncio
import iroh

async def main():
    ep = await iroh.Endpoint.bind(iroh.EndpointOptions(preset=iroh.preset_n0()))
    await ep.online()

    client = await iroh.ServicesClient.create(
        ep,
        iroh.ServicesOptions(api_secret="YOUR_API_KEY", name="my-endpoint"),
    )

    # Your endpoint is now reporting metrics to Iroh Services!

asyncio.run(main())
```

```swift Swift theme={null}
import IrohLib

let endpoint = try await Endpoint.bind(options: EndpointOptions(preset: presetN0()))
await endpoint.online()

let client = try await ServicesClient.create(
    endpoint: endpoint,
    options: ServicesOptions(apiSecret: "YOUR_API_KEY", name: "my-endpoint")
)

// Your endpoint is now reporting metrics to Iroh Services!
```

```kotlin Kotlin theme={null}
import computer.iroh.*
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val endpoint = Endpoint.bind(EndpointOptions(preset = presetN0()))
    endpoint.online()

    val client = ServicesClient.create(
        endpoint,
        ServicesOptions(apiSecret = "YOUR_API_KEY", name = "my-endpoint"),
    )

    // Your endpoint is now reporting metrics to Iroh Services!
}
```

### View Your Endpoint on the Dashboard

Go to your project's **Endpoints** page. You should see your endpoint listed as
online. Click on it to view details.
