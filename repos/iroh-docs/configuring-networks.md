# Deploying to enterprise networks

> What iroh does on your network, what to allow through your firewall, and how to keep it under your control

If a team at your company wants to ship software built on iroh, this page tells
you what it will do on your network, what you need to allow, and what you can
control.

## The one-minute version

* **All traffic is encrypted end to end**, including traffic that passes through
  a relay server. The relay operator cannot read it.
* **You do not have to open anything inward.** There is no inbound rule to write,
  no port to forward, and no static IP to assign. Devices do listen on the UDP
  sockets they bind, and by default iroh asks your gateway for an external port
  over UPnP or NAT-PMP, which you can switch off. See
  [Automatic port opening](#if-automatic-port-opening-is-enabled).
* **Allowing outbound UDP is optional, but recommended.** It makes connections faster and
  cheaper, by being direct, but iroh works without it.
* **You can run all of the infrastructure yourself** if you do not want traffic
  leaving your network.

If you have set up a video conferencing or VoIP system, iroh's requirements will
look familiar. It needs the same two things Teams, Zoom, and WebEx need: a way
for a device to learn its own public address, and a server that can pass traffic
along when two devices cannot reach each other directly.

### Checklist

Firewall and DNS:

* Allow outbound TCP 443 to the relay hostnames with WebSocket support
* Allow outbound TCP 443 to `dns.iroh.link`, or plan to replace address lookup
* Confirm your DNS filtering does not strip TXT records for `dns.iroh.link`
* Allow outbound UDP 7842 to the relay hostnames
* Allow outbound UDP to any destination port. A narrowed range will not work;
  see [why a narrowed range fails](#if-you-allowlisted-a-range-of-udp-ports-and-iroh-still-failed)
* Set your firewall's UDP idle timeout to 30 seconds or more
* Turn off client isolation on wireless segments where devices should reach each other
* Test with `iroh-doctor report` from inside the network

Ask your developers to:

* Tell you which relay hostnames the application is configured with, before
  you write any of the rules above
* Use the operating system certificate store if you inspect TLS traffic
* Configure the proxy address if outbound traffic must be proxied
* Disable automatic port opening, or confirm your gateway has UPnP and NAT-PMP
  turned off already

## What iroh does on your network

iroh is a networking library that your developers build into an application. Its
job is to connect two devices directly, so data moves between them instead of
through a central server.

A device running iroh produces three kinds of traffic.

**Relay connections.** Each device opens one or a few long-lived encrypted
connections to *relay servers* on TCP port 443, as HTTPS requests that upgrade to
a WebSocket. This is the role a TURN server plays in a VoIP system. The relay
introduces two devices to each other and carries their traffic if they cannot
reach each other directly. It is always used, at minimum for the introduction.

**Address lookup.** To find another device, iroh looks up a DNS record for it.
This is an ordinary DNS query through your own resolver.

**Direct connections.** Once introduced, the two devices try to connect straight
to each other over UDP. This part is optional. If a direct connection is not
possible for some reason, the bi-directional connection continues to send data
using the relay.

## What to allow

### Required

| Allow | To | Protocol | Why |
| - | - | - | - |
| Outbound TCP 443 | Your relay hostnames | **HTTPS, upgraded to WebSocket** | The relay connection itself, and the latency checks that pick the closest relay |
| Outbound TCP 443 | `dns.iroh.link` | HTTPS | Publishing the device's address so others can find it |
| Normal DNS (UDP/TCP 53) | Your own resolver | DNS | Looking up other devices |

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Opening TCP 443 is not always enough on its own.** The relay connection starts
> as a standard HTTPS request and then upgrades to a WebSocket, which is the same
> thing a chat application does. If you run an application-aware firewall, a web
> filter, or a proxy that permits ordinary web browsing on port 443 but blocks
> WebSocket upgrades, iroh will not connect at all.
>
> Allow the relay hostnames as a WebSocket destination, not just as an HTTPS one.

### Recommended

Allowing these lets devices connect directly instead of relaying everything.

| Allow | To | Why |
| - | - | - |
| Outbound UDP 7842 | Your relay hostnames | Lets a device learn its own public address. This is the job STUN does in a VoIP system. |
| Outbound UDP, any destination port | Any address | The direct connection between two devices |

### Optional

| Traffic | What it is | Default |
| - | - | - |
| UDP 1900 and UDP 5351 on your local network | Asking the gateway to open an external port (UPnP, NAT-PMP, PCP). Opens an inbound path if your gateway honors it. | On by default, and safe to turn off |
| UDP 5353 multicast on the local network | Finding devices on the same office network | Off unless your developers enable it |

### Hostnames to allow

Which relay hostnames to allow depends on how the application is configured. Ask
your developers, and expect one of three answers.

**Relays you run yourself.** The hostnames are ones you already control, on your
own network or in your own cloud account. See
[Help running your own relay](#help-running-your-own-relay).

**Dedicated relays.** Servers provisioned for your project through Iroh Services
and used by nobody else, on hostnames given to you when they are set up.

**The shared public relays.** Run by [n0](https://n0.computer), the company that
builds iroh, and shared with every other iroh developer worldwide. They are
meant for development and testing rather than production, so treat this as a
sign the application has not been configured yet. The defaults are:

```
use1-1.relay.n0.iroh.link
usw1-1.relay.n0.iroh.link
euc1-1.relay.n0.iroh.link
aps1-1.relay.n0.iroh.link
```

**DNS Service.** The application publishes its address to `dns.iroh.link`, which
is a shared service run by n0. It is used no matter which relays the
application points at, unless your developers have replaced
address lookup with something you run.

If your developers use the [Iroh Services dashboard for monitoring or
diagnostics](https://services.iroh.computer), that traffic travels over the
connections above and needs no extra firewall rules.

## Common situations

### If you block outbound UDP...

**What you will see:** everything works, but more slowly, and all traffic goes
through the relay.

**What is happening:** devices cannot reach each other directly, so every byte
takes a round trip through a relay server.

**What to do:** nothing, if you are willing to accept the cost. It is worth
understanding the trade-off before you decide.

The cost of blocking UDP is added delay proportional to how far away the nearest
relay is, transfer speeds limited by the relay rather than by your own internet
connection, and bandwidth charges on the relay that you either pay for directly
or share with other users of the public relays.

Why allowing it is usually reasonable:

* **This is QUIC, not loose datagrams.** QUIC is a connection-oriented,
  congestion-controlled protocol with a TLS 1.3 handshake. It behaves like a TCP
  connection that happens to run over UDP.
* **Your network almost certainly carries it already.** Chrome, Edge, and Safari
  use HTTP/3 over UDP port 443 for a large share of the web, and every major
  conferencing product uses UDP for media.
* **It is outbound-first.** You write no inbound rule, because the packets coming
  back arrive on a flow your firewall already allowed out. The one exception is
  automatic port opening, which is
  [separately controllable](#if-automatic-port-opening-is-enabled).
* **Idle entries clear quickly.** iroh sends a keepalive while a connection is
  active and gives up on an idle path after a specified timeout. A UDP idle
  timeout of 30 seconds or more on your firewall is recommended.

One thing that does not work: allowing UDP only to port 443. Direct connections
use operating-system-assigned ports on both ends, so a rule scoped to port 443
gains you nothing. Narrowing the range does not work either, for the reasons in
the next section.

> [!TIP]
>
> Two devices on the same office network connect directly to each other regardless
> of whether your perimeter firewall allows UDP. That traffic is governed by your
> internal network policy, so desk-to-desk transfers can stay local even when
> outbound UDP is blocked.

On a network where UDP is silently dropped, the
application can skip trying, which removes probe traffic that shows up in
intrusion detection logs and speeds up startup:

```rust theme={null}
use iroh::endpoint::{presets, PortmapperConfig};
use iroh::Endpoint;

let endpoint = Endpoint::builder(presets::N0)
    // No UDP at all: relay connections only.
    .clear_ip_transports()
    // Do not ask the router to open ports.
    .portmapper_config(PortmapperConfig::Disabled)
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

### If you allowlisted a range of UDP ports and iroh still failed...

**What you will see:** you permit a range such as 50000-60000, and connections
still fail or fall back to the relay, because iroh used a port just outside it
such as 49970.

**What is happening:** iroh does not choose its own port numbers. It binds each
socket with port 0, which asks the operating system for any free port, and the
operating system picks from its *ephemeral port range*. A firewall rule for
outbound UDP matches on the source port, the destination port, or both, and
neither is predictable:

* The **source port** is assigned by the operating system on your own device, out
  of a range that the operating system decides.
* The **destination port** is the other device's source port, assigned by *its*
  operating system. You have no visibility into it and no control over it.

IANA reserves 49152-65535 for ephemeral ports, but not every operating system
follows that, and the range is itself configurable by whoever administers the
machine.

| System | Typical default range | Check it with |
| - | - | - |
| Linux, and Android | 32768-60999 | `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range` |
| Windows | 49152-65535 | `netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport udp` |
| macOS | 49152-65535 | `sysctl net.inet.ip.portrange.first net.inet.ip.portrange.last` |

Linux is the one that catches people out, because its default range starts well
below the IANA number. Treat the table as a starting point and check your own
machines rather than trusting it.

**What to do:** two rules work, and guessing a range is not one of them.

* **Allow outbound UDP to any destination port.** This is the supported
  configuration and the one we recommend.
* **Have the application bind fixed ports**, and scope your rule to exactly
  those. Note that this constrains the *source* port only. The destination is
  still whatever the far device chose, so this helps only if your firewall can
  match on source port.

**For your developers.** One port is bound per socket address, so a device using
both IPv4 and IPv6 needs two. Bind at most one address per family, and clear the
defaults first, because binding more than one per family gives undefined routing
behavior:

```rust theme={null}
use iroh::{Endpoint, endpoint::presets};

let endpoint = Endpoint::builder(presets::N0)
    .clear_ip_transports()
    .bind_addr("0.0.0.0:55555")?
    .bind_addr("[::]:55556")?
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

Read the port numbers from your own configuration rather than hard-coding them,
so they can be set to whatever the network team allowed without a new build.

A fixed port may already be in use, in which case binding fails. If you would
rather start with OS-assigned ports than not start at all, match on
`BindError::Sockets` and build the endpoint again without the fixed addresses:

```rust theme={null}
use iroh::endpoint::BindError;

let endpoint = match Endpoint::builder(presets::N0)
    .clear_ip_transports()
    .bind_addr("0.0.0.0:55555")?
    .bind_addr("[::]:55556")?
    .bind()
    .await
{
    Ok(endpoint) => endpoint,
    Err(BindError::Sockets { .. }) => {
        tracing::warn!("configured ports unavailable, letting the OS assign them");
        Endpoint::builder(presets::N0).bind().await?
    }
    Err(err) => return Err(err.into()),
};
```

### If you inspect TLS traffic...

**What you will see:** the application cannot connect at all, and logs show a
certificate error, even though your inspection appliance's certificate authority
is installed on the machine.

**What is happening:** iroh checks relay certificates against a list of
authorities built into the application. It does not read the operating system's
certificate store, so the certificate authority your device management tool
installed is not trusted.

**What to do:** this is an application change, not a network one.

**For your developers.** Switch iroh to the operating system's certificate
store, which contains the corporate certificate authority:

```rust theme={null}
use iroh::tls::CaTlsConfig;

let endpoint = Endpoint::builder(presets::N0)
    .ca_tls_config(CaTlsConfig::system())
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

This affects the relay connection only. Direct connections between two devices
identify each other by their own cryptographic keys rather than by website
certificates, so an inspection appliance cannot sit in the middle of one. In
practice it would never be in that path anyway.

### If all of your traffic must go through a proxy...

**What you will see:** the application cannot reach a relay at all, because it
tries to connect directly rather than through the proxy.

**What to do:** iroh can send its relay traffic through an HTTP proxy using
`CONNECT`, the same way a browser does. This is an application change.

**For your developers:**

```rust theme={null}
let endpoint = Endpoint::builder(presets::N0)
    // Reads HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy, HTTPS_PROXY, https_proxy, in that order.
    .proxy_from_env()
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

Use `.proxy_url(url)` to set the address explicitly. A proxy only carries the
relay connection, so a proxied deployment usually ends up relaying everything.

### If your DNS filtering blocks iroh...

**What you will see:** connections work when the application is given an address
directly, but fail when it tries to find a device by its identity. That split is
a good sign the problem is DNS rather than the firewall.

**What is happening:** iroh finds devices by looking up a DNS TXT record under
`dns.iroh.link`. Two common configurations break this. Some DNS security
products block or strip TXT records because attackers sometimes use them to
smuggle data. Some internal DNS servers do not forward lookups for outside
domains such as `iroh.link`.

**What to do:** allow `dns.iroh.link` in your DNS filtering policy. If you would
rather not allow it at all, your developers can turn off DNS-based lookup and
distribute addresses through whatever system you already use.

### Guest Wi-Fi or wireless client isolation

**What you will see:** devices on the same wireless network relay their traffic
instead of connecting directly.

**What is happening:** two access point settings prevent local connections.
*Client isolation* (also called AP isolation, station isolation, or peer-to-peer
blocking) stops wireless devices from addressing each other, and is on by
default on most guest networks. *Multicast filtering* prevents devices from
finding each other on the local network.

**What to do:** turn client isolation off on segments where your devices should
be able to reach each other. Neither setting breaks iroh. Both just push traffic
onto the relay that could have stayed on your own network.

### If automatic port opening is enabled...

**What is happening:** by default iroh asks the local gateway to open an external
port for the device, using UPnP, NAT-PMP, or PCP. If your gateway implements one
of those and is configured to honor requests, iroh gets a port mapped and peers
can reach the device directly through it.

This is the one thing iroh does that changes your perimeter without anyone asking
you, so it is worth being explicit about. It is on in a default build. Two things
soften it in practice:

* Most business-grade gateways either do not implement these protocols or have
  them turned off, in which case the request is ignored and nothing changes.
* Connectivity does not depend on it. Without a port mapping, iroh falls back to
  ordinary NAT traversal and then to the relay.

The UPnP discovery step also multicasts to `239.255.255.250:1900`, which is a
common intrusion detection signature and can raise firewall prompts on some
client operating systems.

**What to do:** if your gateway has UPnP or NAT-PMP enabled and you would rather
iroh did not use it, you can turn those protocols off at the gateway, which
affects everything on the network, or have your developers disable it in the
application, which is the narrower fix. On a managed network, disabling it in the
application is the reasonable default.

To check whether your gateway is answering these requests at all, run the
connectivity report described in
[Testing your configuration](#testing-your-configuration). It includes a port
mapping probe.

**For your developers:** `.portmapper_config(PortmapperConfig::Disabled)` on the
endpoint builder, as in the UDP example above.

## Airgapped networks

If no iroh traffic may leave your network, you can replace every piece of
infrastructure outside it with your own, up to and including running fully
airgapped with no internet connection at all. This is the right answer to most
concerns about relays, third-party servers, and data residency.

There are three pieces, and you can replace them independently.

**1. Run your own relay servers**

Run the [relay software](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-relay)
on servers your devices can reach, and have your developers point the
application at them.

**2. Run your own address lookup, or skip it**

Either run an internal
[iroh-dns-server](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-dns-server),
or drop address lookup entirely and distribute device addresses through a system
you already have.

**3. Have the application stop using the shared defaults**

This is a one-line change for your developers. It removes the shared public
relays and DNS server from the application's configuration.

**For your developers:**

```rust theme={null}
use iroh::{Endpoint, RelayMap, RelayMode, RelayUrl, endpoint::presets};

let relay: RelayUrl = "https://relay.internal.example.com".parse()?;

// presets::Empty starts with no external infrastructure configured.
let endpoint = Endpoint::builder(presets::Empty)
    .relay_mode(RelayMode::Custom(RelayMap::from_iter([relay])))
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

**Fully airgapped.** With no internet connection at all, devices can find each
other by multicast on the local network and connect directly, with no relay
involved. This requires your switches to forward multicast and client isolation
to be off. Your developers will find the setup in
[mDNS address lookup](https://docs.iroh.computer/connecting/local-address-lookup.md).

## Help running your own relay

If you want to run your own relay servers, you can! Everything is open source. See [Dedicated
Infrastructure](https://docs.iroh.computer/deployment/dedicated-infrastructure.md) and
[contact us](https://n0.computer/) if you want help with the setup.

## Multiple offices and sites

Skip this section if everything runs at one site.

Each device picks a *home relay*, the one that answers fastest, and publishes
which one it chose. To reach a device, another device connects to **that
device's** home relay, not its own. So the requirement is not that both sites
use the same relay. It is that each side can reach the relay the other side
picked.

That distinction causes most multi-site problems.

| What you set up | What goes wrong | What to do |
| - | - | - |
| A relay at each site, neither reachable from the other | Devices at each site pick their local relay. Neither site can reach the other's, so cross-site connections never work. | Deploy one relay both sites can reach, or make both relays reachable from both sites and list both in the application configuration. |
| Both relays reachable, but the application at one site is only configured with one of them | Devices dial the other relay without the password and get refused. Often looks intermittent or one-directional, because it depends which relay each device happened to pick. | Ship the same relay list and the same password to every site. |
| An internal address lookup server at one site only | The other site cannot find devices by identity. Connections by explicit address still work. | Make the lookup server reachable from both sites, or distribute addresses another way. |
| Site-to-site links that allow TCP 443 but not UDP | Traffic between two of your own offices goes out to a relay and back. | Allow UDP between your site subnets. This is an internal routing policy question, not a perimeter one. |

**What survives a network outage.** Connections that are already direct keep
working when the relay becomes unreachable, because they no longer depend on it.
What stops is anything needing the relay: starting new connections, reconnecting
after a drop, and publishing addresses.

If a site has to keep working through a total internet outage, ask your
developers to enable local network discovery alongside the normal relay
configuration. Devices on the same network segment will keep finding each other
while the link is down, and cross-site connections resume when it returns.

| Your situation | What to deploy |
| - | - |
| One site | One internal relay. Add a second for redundancy. |
| Several sites on a company WAN | Two relays at well-connected sites, both reachable from everywhere, both in the application configuration. Devices sort out which is closer. |
| Sites with no network path between them | Each site is its own separate network. Connecting them needs a relay somewhere both can reach, such as a DMZ or a cloud server. |
| A site that must survive losing its internet link | Normal relay configuration plus local network discovery. |

## Testing your configuration

See [Diagnose a connectivity issue](https://docs.iroh.computer/iroh-services/net-diagnostics/quickstart.md)
for a script you can run from inside your network to confirm the application can
reach the relays and that direct connections work. It is a quick way to check
that your firewall rules are correct, and it produces a report you can send to
your developers to see that everything is working.

## Security and privacy

The questions a security or network review raises, including what a relay can
see, what actually leaves your network, and what running your own relay does and
does not change, are answered in
[Security & Privacy](https://docs.iroh.computer/concepts/security-privacy.md#questions-from-security-reviews).
